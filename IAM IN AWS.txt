1} ETL in aws
2}latency :- delay in time
3}canonical :- alias
4}service :IAM (Identity access management )global service and free service
  Resources :4
  1)Users :- these are simply users, who will use your account to create services and resources.
                                    How to create user? ----> BY CLICKING OPTION ADD USERS
                                      THEIR ARE TWO ACCESS TYPES 1}PROGRAMATIC ACCESS AND 2} CONSOLE ACCESS.
                                      1}CONSOLE ACCESS:- While login console access with the help of username and password provided.
                                      2}programatic access:- all the access other than console access is called programatic access,in which
                                        we can login it with the help 'access key' and 'secrete key'.
  
  2)Groups:-group of users or bunch of users   \\eg- 10 users s3 permission
                                                     group(s3 group) -> s3 permission
      create group--->attach policy -->add user in it
  3)Roles:-COMMUNICATION between two services and resources
  4)Polices:-bunch of permission, given to users ,group and roles.
            policies are of two types 1) AWS managed and 2) coustam managed
            1) aws managed:- provided by aws.
            2) coustam managed:- created by user according to their requirment.
               while creating coustam policy we have two option 1)visual editor and 2)Json editor
              in visual editor we can create policy by graphically, vhile in json editor we can type policy in json language.
              aws has provided a tool called policy generator.
           
5} if user have permission of Adminstrator access then only it can changes permission , otherwise it can't change permission.
6} Administrator :- dominating policy
7} Aws resource from service that can be used to assign permission to any identitiy policy.
8} total 31 regions(Geological location Datacenters) 
   each region have minimum 3 availability zones and maximum 6,7  
9} Availabilty zones-99(server racks)
10} ARN :- unique identity (for ex :- adhar card no)
    in AWS each resource have unique ARN(Amazon resource name)
11}private key :- Authentication  method of the ssh
12} Roles:- communication between two services
    Features of roles:
    1) Better way to provide access
    2)temporary acess
    3)less human interaction
    4)Machine permission
